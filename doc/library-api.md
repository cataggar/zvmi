# Library API

## Inspect UKI signing certificates

Open a supported disk format with `zvmi.Image`, then use
`zvmi.uki_certificate.extractAlloc` to inspect its ESP without mounting it:

```zig
var image = try zvmi.Image.openPathReadOnly(io, "release.qcow2");
defer image.close(io);

const expected = try zvmi.artifact_pipeline.parseSha256(
    "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef",
);
var signer = try zvmi.uki_certificate.extractAlloc(
    allocator,
    io,
    &image,
    .{ .expected_sha256 = expected },
);
defer signer.deinit(allocator);
```

The result owns the exact signer DER, its SHA-256, DER subject/issuer names,
serial number, and sorted fallback/named UKI paths. The API requires one ESP,
one fallback architecture, at least one `EFI/Linux/*.efi`, and the same leaf
certificate on every UKI. QCOW2 dependencies are rejected. Certificate
selection follows CMS `SignerInfo`; extraction does not verify the signature
or establish trust, so callers must independently pin the image and/or
expected fingerprint.

## Use from another `build.zig`

Declare zvmi as a package dependency named `zvmi`, then import its build helper and use the returned `LazyPath` like any other generated file:

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const zvmi = @import("zvmi");

pub fn build(b: *std.Build) void {
    const dependency = b.dependencyFromBuildZig(zvmi, .{
        .target = b.graph.host,
    });

    const image = zvmi.addImage(b, dependency, .{
        .name = "appliance",
        .input = .{
            .iso = b.path("inputs/azurelinux.iso"),
            .container = .{ .oci_layout = b.path("inputs/oci-layout") },
        },
        .output = .{
            .format = .qcow2,
            .basename = "appliance.qcow2",
        },
        .size = 4 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024,
        .target_architecture = .x86_64,
        .generation = .gen2,
        .rootfs_path_in_iso = "images/rootfs.squashfs",
        .reproducibility = .{
            .seed = [_]u8{0x42} ** 32,
            .source_date_epoch = 1_735_689_600,
        },
        .os = .{
            .filesystem = &.{
                .{ .put_file = .{
                    .path = "/etc/appliance.conf",
                    .source = .{ .path = b.path("config/appliance.conf") },
                    .metadata = .{ .mode = 0o640 },
                } },
            },
            .hostname = "appliance",
            .users = &.{.{
                .name = "operator",
                .ssh_authorized_keys = &.{"ssh-ed25519 AAAA..."},
            }},
            .services = &.{.{ .name = "sshd.service", .state = .enabled }},
        },
        .generalization = .{ .azure = .{ .reset_hostname = false } },
        .verity = true,
    });

    const install = b.addInstallFile(image.path, "images/appliance.qcow2");
    const install_provenance = b.addInstallFile(image.provenance_path, "images/appliance.provenance.json");
    b.getInstallStep().dependOn(&install.step);
    b.getInstallStep().dependOn(&install_provenance.step);
}
```

Use `.container = .{ .archive = ... }` for a docker/podman save tarball. OCI layout directories are validated and snapshotted into the Zig build cache so adding, removing, or changing a blob invalidates the image step. Layouts containing symlinks or special files are rejected because Zig 0.16's cached directory-copy step cannot preserve them. The helper runs the dedicated `zvmi-image-builder` artifact for the build host even when the consuming project targets another architecture.

To acquire a registry image as a tracked OCI layout, construct a digest-pinned pull and pass its output directly to `addImage`:

```zig
const pull = zvmi.addOciPull(b, dependency, .{
    .name = "appliance-container",
    .source = "docker://registry.example/team/appliance@sha256:0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef",
    .platform = .{
        .os = "linux",
        .architecture = "amd64",
    },
    // Optional tracked inputs:
    // .authfile = b.path("registry-auth.json"),
    // .tls_ca = b.path("registry-ca.pem"),
});

const image = zvmi.addImage(b, dependency, .{
    .name = "appliance",
    .input = .{
        .iso = b.path("inputs/azurelinux.iso"),
        .container = .{ .oci_layout = pull.layout },
    },
    // Remaining image options...
});
```

`addOciPull` requires a fully qualified `docker://` SHA-256 digest reference and rejects mutable tags while constructing the build graph. Its selected platform defaults to the build host and may be overridden explicitly; all-platform pulls are intentionally not representable because `addImage` consumes a leaf manifest. `authfile` and `tls_ca` are tracked `LazyPath` inputs, and `plain_http` is an explicit development-registry opt-in. The result exposes `layout` and the underlying run `step`; the network request runs only when a dependent build step needs the layout.

`addImage` accepts ordered file/directory/symlink/removal/metadata operations, hostname, groups, users and SSH keys, systemd service state, kernel-module settings, and Azure generalization. File inputs may be inline bytes or tracked `LazyPath` values; plaintext passwords are intentionally not representable, so callers must lock an account or provide a crypt-style pre-hashed value. The helper also returns `plan_path`, `diagnostics_path`, and `provenance_path` from image execution, plus `preflight_plan_path`, `preflight_diagnostics_path`, and `preflight_provenance_path` from a separate non-cacheable capability check. The preflight artifacts remain consumable even when its status gate blocks image execution; unavailable plan or provenance documents contain JSON `null`, while diagnostics explains the failure. Preflight and execution use separate build-cache bundle paths, so their plan hashes intentionally differ; execution repeats preflight against its exact resolved plan before mutation. Successful execution bundles are reused only when a content key covering the host builder, complete request arguments, ISO, container, customization document, and tracked files still matches; failed or stale bundles are cleared and retried instead of becoming permanent cache hits. The target architecture, rootfs path, deterministic seed, and source timestamp are explicit inputs; the resolved plan records generated identifiers and operation ordering, while provenance records source, final root-tree, and output SHA-256 hashes.

To transactionally edit an existing image, use the typed `addPreservedImage` helper:

```zig
const preserved = zvmi.addPreservedImage(b, dependency, .{
    .name = "updated-appliance",
    .input = .{
        .disk = b.path("inputs/appliance.qcow2"),
        .dependencies = &.{
            b.path("inputs/base.qcow2"),
            b.path("inputs/base-data.raw"),
        },
    },
    .root_partition = .{ .gpt_index = 2 },
    .output = .{
        .format = .qcow2,
        .basename = "updated-appliance.qcow2",
    },
    .target_architecture = .x86_64,
    .backend = .rebuild,
    .reproducibility = .{
        .seed = [_]u8{0x24} ** 32,
        .source_date_epoch = 1_735_689_600,
    },
    .operations = &.{
        .{ .overwrite_file = .{
            .path = "/etc/appliance.conf",
            .source = .{ .path = b.path("config/appliance.conf") },
        } },
        .{ .overwrite_file = .{
            .path = "/etc/build-id",
            .source = .{ .inline_bytes = "release-24\n" },
        } },
        .{ .remove_file = "/etc/obsolete.conf" },
        .{ .remove_tree = "/var/cache/obsolete" },
    },
    .os = .{
        .filesystem = &.{
            .{ .put_file = .{
                .path = "/etc/new-appliance.conf",
                .source = .{ .inline_bytes = "created-by=rebuild\n" },
            } },
            .{ .put_directory = .{ .path = "/opt/appliance" } },
        },
        .hostname = "updated-appliance",
    },
});
```

The disk, every transitive qcow2 backing or external-data file, the generated operation configuration, and every replacement are tracked `LazyPath` inputs; inline bytes are materialized through `WriteFiles`. Runtime preflight opens the disk read-only and requires the declared dependency set to exactly match its actual transitive qcow2 closure. The host-native runner preserves the source virtual size, flattens qcow2 dependencies into a standalone output, and returns the same result, preflight, and status-gate artifacts as `addImage`, including when the dependency was configured for a foreign target. GPT and MBR selectors are one-based.

`addPreservedImage` defaults to `.backend = .native_edit`, which only overwrites existing regular files, removes existing non-directories, and recursively removes existing directories. Select `.backend = .rebuild` to strictly import a writer-compatible `zvmi_ext4_v1` filesystem into owned storage, create/remove files, directories, and symlinks, change represented metadata, apply the pure OS customization model, and generalize the image before rebuilding only the selected partition. Rebuild preserves the ext4 UUID, exact label field, geometry, global timestamp, supported node contents/metadata/xattrs, and every byte outside the selected filesystem; it rejects arbitrary ext4 features, hardlinks, special or sparse files, divergent timestamps, noncanonical root metadata, and partition padding rather than discarding them. Native edit and rebuild do not resize partitions, run package managers, regenerate initramfs, or execute guest code.

Select `.backend = .unsafe_chroot` with `.acknowledge_unsafe = true` to use the first privileged preserved-image executor. It is Linux-only, requires effective root plus `CAP_SYS_CHROOT`, `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`, and `CAP_MKNOD`, and supports only same-architecture execution against an explicitly selected Linux ext4 partition. The current slice accepts online unlocked package install/remove actions through `/usr/bin/tdnf`, literal repository IDs with explicit trust material, and dracut regeneration for explicit kernel releases with `--no-hostonly`; dracut builds the replacement on the executor's private `/run` tmpfs before copying it over the existing guest initramfs, avoiding transient or duplicate persistent-space requirements. It rejects package updates, cache-only and version-lock policies, package paths/URLs/RPM files, existing-path and OS customization, generalization, hooks, SELinux changes, boot-policy changes, and cross-architecture runners before workspace mutation.

The unsafe executor runs in private mount and PID namespaces with a fresh minimal `/dev`, `/proc`, read-only `/sys`, tmpfs `/run`, isolated TDNF repository configuration, and optional read-only resolver binding. **This is cleanup isolation, not a security sandbox:** package managers and package scriptlets execute as root against the host kernel. Cleanup must unmount every child and detach the selected-partition loop device before publication; uncertain cleanup retains the transaction and active lease instead of deleting potentially mounted storage. Successful provenance records tool versions, exact mutation commands, and the final installed package NEVRAs.

Lower-level backends can use `zvmi.preserved_image.transactRaw` to flatten a source read-only into an exclusive raw stage, receive the selected partition geometry through a mutation hook, and publish raw, VHD, VHDX, or QCOW2 only after the hook releases every child, mount, loop attachment, and file reference. The transaction runtime pins staging-file identity and uses an external sealed lease barrier so cleanup never recursively removes an active backend workspace.

## Runtime customization API

The library exposes the same versioned request-plan runtime used by `addImage`:

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const customize = @import("zvmi").customize;

pub fn main(init: std.process.Init) !void {
    const allocator = init.arena.allocator();
    const request = customize.Request{
        .target_architecture = .x86_64,
        .input = .{ .iso_oci = .{
            .iso_path = "azurelinux.iso",
            .container_path = "oci-layout",
            .rootfs_path_in_iso = "images/rootfs.squashfs",
        } },
        .output = .{ .path = "appliance.qcow2", .format = .qcow2, .size = 4 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024 },
        .storage = .{ .fresh = .{} },
        .os = .{
            .filesystem = &.{
                .{ .put_file = .{
                    .path = "/etc/appliance.conf",
                    .source = .{ .host_path = "config/appliance.conf" },
                } },
            },
            .hostname = "appliance",
            .services = &.{.{ .name = "sshd.service", .state = .enabled }},
        },
        .generalization = .{ .azure = .{ .reset_hostname = false } },
        .execution = .{ .workspace_path = "." },
        .reproducibility = .{
            .seed = .{ .bytes = [_]u8{0x42} ** 32 },
            .source_date_epoch = 1_735_689_600,
        },
    };

    var resolved = try customize.resolve(allocator, &request, .{ .host_architecture = .x86_64 });
    defer resolved.deinit(allocator);
    if (resolved.plan == null) return error.InvalidConfiguration;

    var capabilities = try customize.preflight(allocator, init.io, &resolved.plan.?, customize.Platform.system());
    defer capabilities.deinit(allocator);
    if (!capabilities.ready()) return error.PreflightFailed;

    var outcome = try customize.execute(allocator, init.io, &resolved.plan.?, customize.Platform.system(), null);
    defer outcome.deinit(allocator);
    if (outcome.result == null) return error.ImageBuildFailed;
}
```

`resolve` is deterministic and does not inspect or mutate the host. The `native_fresh`, `native_edit`, strict `rebuild`, and `unsafe_chroot` backends require `workspace_path` to be the parent directory of `output.path`, keeping all planned scratch state on the destination filesystem for atomic publication. `preflight` returns all missing capabilities, and `execute` repeats preflight before mutation, stages the image in a planned transaction directory, verifies that source hashes remain unchanged, and atomically publishes the final output. Validation, preflight, and execution diagnostics are structured and independently owned; successful results include source hashes, resolved configuration, generated or preserved-image metadata, source/final rebuild tree manifests, and the final artifact hash.

`customize.current_api_version` identifies the v3 request contract. `adaptV2NativeFresh` explicitly converts the frozen v2 ISO+OCI/native request shape; v3 validation never silently reinterprets a request labeled as v2. Plan and provenance JSON have independent `schema_version` fields so artifact consumers can reject or migrate formats separately.

The v3 contract implements rootless `native_fresh`, constrained `native_edit`, strict writer-compatible `rebuild`, and the limited Linux `unsafe_chroot` package/initramfs slice described above. It also models the unimplemented `vm` backend, ordered hooks, SELinux policy, and cross-architecture runners; unsupported combinations derive semantic capabilities and fail preflight before workspace creation. Direct `customize.execute` users must provide a `Platform` with unsafe runtime callbacks, while `addPreservedImage` wires the host-native preserved-image builder automatically.

`zvmi.root_tree.RootTree` is the lower-level owned filesystem API. It spools bounded file and symlink content independently of ISO, SquashFS, OCI, or ext4 reader lifetimes; owns paths and POSIX metadata; applies deterministic replacement and recursive removal; and exposes a stable manifest digest. `ext4View()` adapts a validated tree to `zvmi.ext4.populate`, while `populateFat32()` either requires FAT-representable metadata or applies the caller's explicit lossy POSIX-metadata policy. Unsupported hardlinks, special files, timestamps, or metadata are rejected rather than silently discarded.

`zvmi.preserved_image.edit` is the lower-level constrained existing-path API, while `zvmi.preserved_image.rebuild` performs the strict full-tree rebuild described above. Both accept raw, VHD, VHDX, or qcow2 disks, copy guest-visible bytes into exclusive raw staging, flatten qcow2 backing chains, operate on an explicitly selected one-based GPT or MBR partition, convert to a standalone output, and publish without replacing an existing destination. Sources and backing files are opened read-only.
